            Founded in 2015 by Ben, Beth, and Alex (hence 'bba'), our practice has grown to a team of 15 architects, designers, and support staff working on projects across the UK and Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We believe that good architecture responds to its context, serves the needs of its users, and stands the test of time. Our work is characterized by clarity of thought, attention to detail, and a commitment to quality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Based in London, we work on projects of all scales, from private homes to public buildings, always bringing the same level of care and consideration to each.

            We believe that architecture should respond to its physical, cultural, and historical context. Each project begins with a thorough understanding of the site and its surroundings.
